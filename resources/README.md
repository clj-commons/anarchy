# Anarchy - logic without rules.

A minimalist pure-clojure port of the unbalanced trees model of [DTRules](http://www.dtrules.com/)

No dependencies except clojure itself.

## What does it do?

Anarchy gives you a model you can build a UI around that programmers and non-programmers alike can grok.

The following  two examples are equivalent using two different matching logics.

Example 1 ("first match wins" logic):

Conditions | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6
-----------| --|---|---|---|---|---
A == 0     | Y | Y |   |   |   |
B > 5      |   |   | Y | Y |   |
A == C     | Y | N | Y | N | Y | N
**Actions**    | **1** | **2** | **3** | **4** | **5** | **6**
Print "A is 0" | X | X |   |   |   |
Print "B > 5"  |   |   | X | X |   |
Print "A == C" | X |   | X |   | X |

Example 2 ("all matches" logic):

Conditions | 1 | 2 | 3
-----------| --|---|---|
A == 0     | Y | N |   |
B > 5      |   | Y |   |
A == C     |   |   | Y |
**Actions**    | **1** | **2** | **3**
Print "A is 0" | X |   |
Print "B > 5"  |   | X |
Print "A == C" |   |   | X

Note: for some problems, first match wins may result in simpler decision tables

These (hotlinked) images are courtesy of DTRules (upon whose excellent ideas anarchy is based).
Sadly there is a bug in them: the last line of the table should read (A == B) and I haven't produced new images yet.

## Usage

```clojure
(ns my.ns
 (:require [irresponsible.anarchy :refer [match-conds match-actions]]))
 
;; The examples below are both equivalent to this clojure code
;; which I translated from java code on the dtrules site
(do
  (if (= (:a data) 0)
    (prn "a is 0")
    (when (> (:b data) 5)
      (prn "b > 5")))
  (when (= (:a data) (:c data))
    (prn "a == c")))

;; You needn't use a map, but it's an obvious choice
(def data {:a 0 :b 5 :c 0})
(def conds [#(= (:a %) 0)
            #(> (:b %) 5)
            #(= (:a %) (:c %))])

;; for each example, we need a conditions matrix and an actions matrix
;; here we have the the "first match wins" matrices first
;; each row in the conditions matrix is a seq/vector of [identifier & expected]
;;   - there should be an expected value for each condition in order
;;   - a boolean value matches only itself
;;   - a nil may also be provided as a "don't care about this condition" value
(def cond-matrix-1
  [[:a true nil true]
   [:b true nil false]
   [:c nil true true]
   [:d nil true false]
   [:e nil nil true]
   [:f nil nil false]])
;; each row in the action matrix is a two vector
;; - the action to be returned (any data you like, we use functions here)
;; - set containing the identifiers for which this action should apply
(def action-matrix-1
  [#(prn "a is 0") #{:a :b}]
  [#(prn "b > 5, a != 0")  #{:c :d}]
  [#(prn "a == c") #{:a :c :e}])
;; the "all matches" matrices:
(def cond-matrix-2
  [[:a true nil nil]
   [:b false true nil]
   [:c nil nil true]])
(def action-matrix-2
  [#(prn "a is 0") #{:a}]
  [#(prn "b > 5, a!= 0")  #{:b}]
  [#(prn "a == c") #{:c}])

;; First match wins example
(doseq [h (->> (a/match-conds cond-matrix-1 conds data) ;; returns a lazy seq
               (take 1) ;; first match wins, so limit it to one match
               (a/match-actions action-matrix-1))] ;; return a lazy seq of all actions implied by that match
 (h)) ;; as we return functions, we just call them
;; All matches example
(doseq [h (->> (a/match-conds cond-matrix-2 conds data) ;; we use the whole lazy seq this time
               (a/match-actions action-matrix-2))]
  (h))
```
